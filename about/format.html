<h2>Book structure</h2>

<p>At the top level, books are listed by language: en, ru ...
Each language is a separate book.</p>

<p><b>The book content resides in files with <code>.md</code> extension.</b>
There may be asset files like scripts, styles etc.
A book content may use them, but no parsing and formatting is applied to non-<code>.md</code> files.</p>

<p><b>Book pages and chapters must start with a digital number followed by a hyphen</b>: 01-..., 02-... etc.
It is used for sorting.</p>

<p>Anything ending with <code>.bak</code> is ignored.</p>

<p>The title is inferred from the first header of the page.
For a folder (chapter), the file <code>00-index.md</code> is used for this purpose. This file should have at least a header. You can also add few introductory paragraphs.</p>

<p>Tasks for the chapter must be in the <code>task</code> subfolder.</p>

<p>Encoding is <b>UTF-8</b>. Line breaks are <b>unix-style: \n</b>.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>Browser navigation by using <code>nav.html</code>.</p>

<p><b>Navigation does not autopickup your changes.</b>
If you change the structure or references, then the navigation needs to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>JavaScript is unable to traverse the directory tree, that's why a signed Java Applet is used. It gets executed only when rebuilding navigation.</p>

<p>Actually, the applet is small, simplified and secured to maximum. All it can do is to get file names inside a folder and write to file which ends with '.applet.json'. For additional security, it only works locally, so if anyone tries to put it on the web, nothing would work.

<p>The sources are in the <code>engine/jpath</code> folder. If you feel really paranoid, recompile it and sign by your certificate.</p>

<p>Please never click "Trust always" on it.</p>


<h2>Layout</h2>

<h3>Page layout</h3>
<pre>
    # Title

    This is a short intro to the page.
    The cut below is optional, but recommended.
    If there is no cut, then several first lines are used.

    =Cut

    The body.

    =Head

    Scripts, styles, other unformatted stuff that goes to HEAD.
</pre>

<p>All sections (starting with <code>"="</code>) are optional.</p>

<h3>Task layout</h3>

<pre>
    # Title

    The body, task formulation.

    =Hint 1
    ...
    =Hint n
    ...
    =Solution
    ...

</pre>

<p>All sections are optional, the solution should exist.</p>

<h2>Formatting</h2>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p>Headers starts from <code>#</code>:</p>
<pre>
# Title
## SubTitle
</pre>

<p>There should be only one 1st-level header in the document: the title.</p>

<p>A header may have id:</p>
<pre>
## Header with id [id]
</pre>

<h3>External Links</h3>
<p>Links can be written as <code>[title](url)</code>, for example:</p>
<pre>
    [Google](http://google.com)
    ["Title with backslashed quote: \", [ and ] "](http://somewhere.com)
</pre>

<p>To put a link which name is same as URL, use empty <code>()</code>:</p>
<pre>
    [http://google.com]()
</pre>

<h3>Internal links and references</h3>
<p>All internal links must be made through references, not URLs.
The purpose of such structure is to ensure consistency across the book. All references are global and unique.</p>

<p>A <i>reference</i> is created with <code>[#id]</code> anywhere in the text. A reference must be latin alphanumeric with hyphens.</p>

<pre>
    [#events-this]
</pre>

<p>It may have a title after <code>|</code>:</p>

<pre>
    [#closure-peculiarity|Closure Peculiarity]
</pre>
<p>Headers with <code>[id]</code> can be used as titled references.</p>

<p>To make an internal link link, use <code>[title](#id)</code>, for example:</p>
<pre>
    Somewhere: [#good-info]

    Now the link: [Good reading](#good-info)
</pre>

<p>A link can also use the reference title:</p>
<pre>
    This will show up as "Good reading" link: [](#good-info)
</pre>

<h2>Bold, italic</h2>

Use <code>*text*</code> for italic, <code>**text**</code> for bold.

If there are spaces, it won't get formatted: <code>a * b * c</code> leaves formatting as is, because there are spaces around '*'.'

Instead of asterisks, one can use underlines, like this: <code>_italic_ __bold__</code>.

<h2>Code</h2>

<h3>Inline code</h3>

<p>The inline code in backtricks <code>`code`</code> is wrapped into <code>CODE</code> tag.</p>

<p>To use backtricks inside the code, put double backtricks around it:</p>
<pre>
    `` `which` `` -> &lt;code&gt;`which`&lt;/code&gt;
</pre>

<p>All special chars inside code are replaced inside <code>`...`</code>. You can write <code>`&lt;body&gt;`</code>.
But even if you want to use tags, they won't work. For example:</p>
<pre>
    `&lt;body&gt;` -> &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</pre>

<p>To use tags inside the inline code code, use the <code>CODE</code> tag:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;code&gt;on&lt;i&gt;event&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Code blocks</h3>

<p>A code block is wrapped in bb-tags: </p>

<pre>
    [html]
    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/html&gt;
    [/html]
</pre>

<p>Other languages supported(by extensions): <code>js, css, java, ruby, php, txt, py, xml, xslt, html, erl</code>.</p>

A code block can be made runnable by adding a <code>run</code> attribute:
<pre>
    [html run]
    &lt;p&gt; A "run" button will appear above the code block &lt;/p&gt;
    [/html]
</pre>

<p>The attribute <code>autorun</code> makes html/js code run automatically.
For book pages, the execution happens on the same domain, in iframe for HTML or eval for JS.</p>

<p>Important parts of the code can be delimited by <code>*!* ... */!*</code>.</p>
<pre>
    [js]
    var body = *!*document.body*/!* // inline

    *!*
    alert(body) // block
    body.innerHTML = 5
    */!*
    [/js]
</pre>

<h3>Code inclusions</h3>

<p>For a larger code, you may want to put it into a file and use the <code>src</code> attribute:</p>

<pre>
    [js run src="assets/my.js"][/js]
</pre>

<p>The path is resolved relative to the current page. The absolute path is resolved relative to the book. External URLs like http://... are not allowed.</p>

<h2>Special chars</h2>

<p>Special characters '&lt;', '&gt;' and '&amp;' are autoreplaced in a smart way. You can put them in the text:</p>
<pre>
    a &lt; b  // autoreplaced to a &amp;lt; b
    &lt;a&gt; // not autoreplaced, tags still work
</pre>

<h2>Verbatim pieces</h2>

No format happens inside <code>[verbatim]</code> bb-tag:
<pre>
    [verbatim]
    `no format [#here]`
    [/verbatim]
</pre>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<ul><li>
Put files and other assets locally. Try to evade the root <code>assets</code> folder unless the content is really global.
</li>
<li>Use SVG for illustrations.</li>
</ul>
